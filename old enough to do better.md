Alright, alright, alright (coughing in McConaughey-iss)  
Just the same as every year the birthday wish is DEAR SWEET LORD MAKE ME TALL but you and I can tell that it never came true. Never made it to the god's favorite child list anyway.  
Started it all with Taylor Swift's 22, well duhhh!!! And end with the same. Also started as a redhead wannabe baddie, what a thing to be human!! Now the dye is just dead.  
It sure was a decent year and the age as a number sounds every serious, but let's just say 23 years of my mom's motherhood and she still says "idk, I'm new to this" gives me hope that it is what it is and try not to give too many fs.  
From spamming my spam to ranting on Letterboxd we did it all.

## Whimsy
I realize the little things are just as important as large, extra large and XXL. Whimsy is the way. The very fact that I started to play Imperial March in my head every time on my way to the toilet and the way I try to do a small hand flick while the elevator door closes and think the force is strong with me isn't just about Star Wars, the lightness of life, the whimsical-ness, the utter silliness.  

Also I wondered: did the men's room at the office have blue doors? Or us ladies force welcomed to pink doors? And why does that damn work chair not get the concept of moving in a straight line?  

And when water is room temperature from being cold, it lost the coldness or gained warmth?? (did not give a flying f in thermodynamics and it shows).

## Ignorance
Ignorance is bliss, surely! But damn the way you feel after that one crying session! is the only way out.  

I think humans are very well crafted by the lord with all the emotions you feel and yes us losers (humans) failed to create words to express them.  

Gotta love life.

## Yearning
The fact that there are people I don't even know yet who might someday be the ones I'll miss --- that's wild.  

But most of all, I think I miss the feeling of not knowing anything, and not knowing that I didn't know anything. That kind of innocence feels like freedom in hindsight.

## Wisdom and Spirituality
**Same cities, but different streets:** The sense of warmth just doesn't hit the same. I cannot fathom this enough and put this in words. balled to Vienna by billy joel EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Its just genuinely heavy.  

**Personality:** As long as I can make a silly joke I think there's nothing to worry about personality, I guess.
Being introverted and socially odd are two entirely different things, Also kinda realized love and romantic interests are two very different things (ik mother you are just smiling reading this). And the right people will always walk in just the way wrong ones walk out.  

Bhai bhai bhai, I'm very not comfy with fact that I recalled Deepika Padukone's sequence from YJHD "kuch waqt do, sab theek hojayega." Many, many times and never NEVER not failed to feel wholesome.  

Finally I started appreciating humanly things and humans around, just a little interaction goes a long way. Always.  

Most notable things would be falling back in love with The Beatles and light-hearted music and slowly making progress towards being a full-time movie critic.  

Making peace with "there's nothing that's 'okay', 'bearable'—there's just 'good' or 'bad'."  

We're old, but wise? NOPE!

## Few 'not bads'
An hour a day at least for artistry, music, poetry, literature, storytelling and MOVIES most of all. Movies. This year's favourite would definitely be One battle after another(PTA... XD) then maybe F1 from the big screens.  

THE WILD ROBOT, A Real Pain, Breakfast Club, ... are definitely the best I watched this year but rewatching "Call Me By Your Name" just made me cry harder than before. Yeah, as a 22 yo I did appreciate it much better than at 18 years old.  

Well! "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" is just what I needed to fuel the thought of "leave it all gal". And Little Miss Sunshine slapped and taught the power of family. And 50 First Dates was also fun, but I found Prisoners is more of my game.  

Obviously we rewatched all Star Wars, Breaking Bad.  

And the best anime will be Wild Robot and Spirited Away and BLUEYYYYYYYYYY. I see a lot of potential here.  

Career-wise, I think we're okay-ish, but the constant loop is punishing.  

"Wins at work are NOT your personal wins" was something I found profound. I clearly wanna go back to academia.  

Kept the LeetCode streak: 320 and ongoing. GitHub is green. Awfully proud of that.  

Yelled, "How can a person know everything at 18 but nothing at 22?" on top of my lungs. Jammed to good GOOOOOD music.

## Few Regrets
- Didn't finish the movie list for the year.  
- Didn't get that haircut nor the dye. (My 21-year-old self is literally laughing).  
- Misjudged a few things.  
- Over-expected and under-delivered.  
- Was just too smug for my own good.

## Few Copy-Pastes for Next Year
- Be better, do better.  
- Fix the damn sleep schedule and try not to spend on Netflix and HBO.  
- Invest time in real things.

## Few proud jokes
- Why 2 events bro, wedding and the reception? Ever heard of 2-factor authentication? Brow.  
- I know a guy who knows a guy who knows another guy, let's get that drugs going, Saul.

all in all its just is a beautiful thing to alive, to be able to drink cold water at 2am is beautiful, to smell the fresh scent of pages is bueatiful, to feel the warmness of the blanket is beautiful, routine is a beautiful thing, having people one call away is the true wealth, painfully long discussions on most niche topics is beautiful, .
ahhhhhhhhhhhhh

but you know whats hot? WIRED EARPHONES

All in all, life’s just… beautifully ridiculous. The little things hit harder than we think: cold water at 2 AM, the fresh scent of pages, a warm blanket, routines that somehow ground you, friends a call away, endlessly nerdy conversations, having people who have the same music taste is a BLESSINGGG

Ahhhhhhhh… but let’s be real, you know what’s actually hot? WIRED EARPHONES.
